# windaq3
Enable Python 3.x to work with windaq .WDQ files without first exporting to CSV or other human readable format

This library works with small to medium windaq files.
For large files (+4GB) see my library that handles large files by converting them to numpy files.

Check out example.ipynb for usage.
